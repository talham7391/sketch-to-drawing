# sketch-to-drawing

### Objective

This library should be able to take a hand drawn sketch (with a blank background & no shading), and convert it to a digital image where:
- The sketch lines are replaced with curves & lines
- Enclosed faces are detected (so that they can be colored in...)

There are sample sketch images in the repository to test out the library.
